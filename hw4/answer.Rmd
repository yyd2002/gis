# Ineqaulity task - week 4

### Read in data:

Located within the Data folder:

* HDI data from: https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/documentation-and-downloads
* Shapefile from: https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/2b93b06dc0dc4e809d3c8db5cb96ba69_0/explore?location=-2.688200%2C0.000000%2C1.41 

## Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(countrycode)
```

## read in data

```{r}
HDI <- read_csv(here::here("data", "HDR23-24_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv"),
                       locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"),
                       na = " ", skip=0)

World <- st_read("data/World_Countries.geojson")

```

## Column names

* World shape has the column ISO2
* HDI has ISO3
* We could join on country name?

Select columns we want and change country name to country code, using the `countrycode` package

We could also just join it without this on the country name column 

Some notes:

* COW codes = correlates of war codes
* ISO = International Organization for Standardization with 2 or 3 letters...

```{r}
HDIcols<- HDI %>%
  clean_names()%>%
  select(iso3, country, gii_2019, gii_2010)%>%
  mutate(difference=gii_2019-gii_2010)%>%
  #not needed here as we can now use the country name...but see below
  mutate(iso_code=countrycode(country, origin = 'country.name', destination = 'iso2c'))%>%
  mutate(iso_code2=countrycode(iso3, origin ='iso3c', destination = 'iso2c'))

  
```

## Join

Join the csv to world shape file

```{r}
Join_HDI <- World %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  left_join(., 
            HDIcols,
            # change to "aff_iso" = "iso_code"
            # by = c("iso" = "iso_code"))
            by = c("aff_iso" = "iso_code"))

# 261 if using "aff_iso", 251 if using "iso". Could filter out the NA values.
```

If using affiliate code then Aruba (country) is part of the Netherlands (affiliate country).

Aruba is a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

If using iso code then Aruba will have no data as it has no data in the HDI. 

We could also use the country column to join...

```{r}
Join_HDI_2 <- World %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  left_join(., 
            HDIcols,
            by = c("country" = "country"))
#251

```

## Problems 

* With Join_HDI there are 11 rows for Antarctica **if using aff_iso** - be sure to use iso column or remove the NA values as in the aff_iso Antarctica is NA. Within the HDI dataset there are a series of rows for collections (e.g. World and Very high human development counties). So this join is being done on the `NA` values. For example, the `aff_iso` for Antarctica is NA and the ISO code for Very high human development counties is also NA!


* With Join_HDI_2 (that uses country name to join) the entries for other islands aren't joined as they don't have the same name...for example, Anguilla, Bermuda, Falkland Islands..... 

These are The British Overseas Territories (BOTs), also known as the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), fourteen territories with a constitutional and historical link with the United Kingdom, but do not form part of the United Kingdom itself.

Should the HDI value for the UK be assigned to the The British Overseas Territories ?

```{r}
Join_HDI_GB<-Join_HDI %>%
  filter(aff_iso=="GB")

Join_HDI_2_GB<-Join_HDI_2 %>%
  filter(aff_iso=="GB")
```


..next time we will make a map using different repos
